### Evaluation

- 8 problem sets (50%)
- 1 midterm exam (20%): Wednesday March 18
- 1 final project (30%)

Problem sets will consist of a mixture of theory and coding. They will be submitted and graded online.

The final project will be an exploration of a topic in numerical analysis that we have not covered in class (although at the level of the class), and will include a discussion of the mathematics behind the method, together with your own implementation.


### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/dpsanders/18.330
```
This will create a new directory called `6.S083` with the matierials.


- Update it to pull in new changes
```
git pull
```
This needs to be executed from within the directory. (Use `cd` to change directory.)
