    "# Big-$\\mathcal{O}$ notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, we are given some complicated function\n",
    "$f(x)$, and we would like to make a *qualitative statement*\n",
    "about how $f(x)$ behaves as $x$ approaches some large (or small) value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being mathematicians, we want our qualitative statement still\n",
    "to be rigorous, and that's where Big-$\\mathcal{O}$ notation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\mathcal{O}(g(x)) \\qquad x\\rightarrow a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "if for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "|f(x)| \\leq C g(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for some fixed, positive constant $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: As $x$ tends to $a$, $f(x)$ *grows no faster than* $g(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: The way we use the \"equal\" sign in Big-$\\mathcal{O}$ notation is a slight \"abuse \n",
    "of notation\". Normally we would expect that the equals sign is reflexive: $a=b$ implies $b=a$.\n",
    "However, note that for $x\\rightarrow \\infty$, $\\mathcal{O}(x) = \\mathcal{O}(x^2)$ but not\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(x^2) = \\mathcal{O}(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this notation is standard now, and not likely to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Very often, $a=\\infty$, for instance when looking at complexity of algorithms,\n",
    "we are often faced with polynomials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(n) = 15 n^3 + \\log(n) + 4 n^4 + 2n\n",
    "$$\n",

    "For such sums of terms, the *fastest growing* term wins out, so\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(n) = \\mathcal{O}(n^4).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you really wanted it to do formally you could note that for $n$ sufficiently large,\n",
    "$15n^3 \\leq 15n^4, \\log(n) \\leq n^4, 2n \\leq 2n^4$.\n",
    "This leads to $|f(n)| \\leq 15n^4 + n^4 + 4 n^4 + 2n^4 \\leq 22 n^4 $, with $C=22$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "Another common case is $a=0$, for instance when doing Taylor expansions (as we have done in class before).\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin(x + h) = \\sin(x) + h \\cos(x) - h^2 \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(x) + h^3 \\frac{1}{6} \\cos(x) - ...  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's the *slowest decaying* term that wins out. If we wanted to estimate the remainder\n",
    "after the linear term proportional to $h$, we could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin(x+h) = \\sin(x) + h\\cos(x) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the interpretation is that the remainder *decays no slower than* $h^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise: Determine the Big-$\\mathcal{O}$ for $f(h) = 2 h + h^2 - 12 h^5$ formally, i.e., find the constant $C$ for sufficiently small $h$."
